Experience

{{< cv/experience
  name="University at Buffalo Libraries"
  date="October 2024 - Present"
  title="Library Developer"
  location="Buffalo, NY" >}}

* At the UB Library I build applications to help support library operations, mostly in Python and Django, but there's a little Ruby and Ruby on Rails mixed in too. Notable projects include:
* Gutenberg - An app to facilitate printing duplicate barcode stickers for the Libraries Annex on desktop Zebra printers
* Alexandria - An app that more than doubled the scan rate of our student workers when weeding the collection. It interfaces with our library management software, Alma, via asynchronous API calls.
* Scionto - An app that parses a messy EZProxy config file, provides a nice user friendly interface for maintaining EZProxy stanzas, and generates fresh config files. It aims to be a one stop EZProxy stanza management tool.
* Hycastor - Our Hyrax/Ruby on Rails based digital asset management system. Yes, it's name is a portmanteau of Hyrax and castor, because dams are built by beavers...

{{< cv/experience
  name="Preteckt"
  date="January 2020 – February 2024"
  title="Full Stack Software Engineer"
  location="Memphis, TN" >}}

* As a full stack software engineer at Preteckt I helped reduce technical debt and modernize a large Django project, keeping the project on the latest LTS releases. I designed and built several user interfaces for both internal and external customers, working closely with other teams and departments to optimize the new interfaces to facilitate user efficiency and accessibility. I implemented websockets to better handle loading large data payloads in a React frontend. I also used websockets and HTMX to create a single page-like interface with standard Django functional views that updated based on the actions of other users. I also did a lot work to make the development experience better, including helping to dockerize the development environment, constructing a Javascript build process, improving documentation and testing. I was also part of an employee culture committee, gave several lunch and learns on various topics, and mentored interns and people from other teams.

{{< cv/experience
  name="Lensrentals"
  date="May 2019 – January 2020"
  title="Software Development Intern"
  location="Memphis, TN" >}}

* As a development intern at Lensrentals I have learned a lot about React Native based mobile development. The project I was tasked with involved writing several parts of the existing web based Ruby on Rails application as a React Native based solution to run on Zebra's Android platforms. The goal was to incorporated mobile devices in the warehouse's workflow to enable warehouse workers to be more precise and efficient.

{{< cv/experience
  name="MD2K (University of Memphis)"
  date="January 2018 - May 2019"
  title="Undergraduate Research Assistant"
  location="Memphis, TN" >}}

* As an undergraduate research assistant my responsibilities include documenting the
existing codebase, developing applications to help demonstrate the functionality of
the system, writing functional tests, and maintaining the Gitlab CI pipeline. My last
work project consisted of implementing a way to package data collected from phone
sensors into MessagePack files. These files were then uploaded to the cloud and
converted into Parquet files to streamline the cloud architecture.
