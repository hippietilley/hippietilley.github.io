  location="Memphis, TN" >}}

* As a full stack software engineer at Preteckt I helped reduce technical debt and modernize a large Django project, keeping the project on the latest LTS releases. I designed and built several user interfaces for both internal and external customers, working closely with other teams and departments to optimize the new interfaces to facilitate user efficiency and accessibility. I implemented websockets to better handle loading large data payloads in a React frontend. I also used websockets and HTMX to create a single page-like interface with standard Django functional views that updated based on the actions of other users. I also did a lot work to make the development experience better, including helping to dockerize the development environment, contructing a Javascript build process, improving documentation and testing. I was also part of an employee culture committee, gave several lunch and learns on various topics, and mentored interns and people from other teams.
