# Ingredients

- 3 lbs boneless pork loin roast cut into large pieces
- 2 teaspoons Kosher salt
- 4 teaspoons ancho chile powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1-2 tablespoons olive oil
- 12 fluid oz beer (or chicken stock), preferably with citrus notes. Blue Moon or another Belgian wheat beer works well
- 1 freshly squeezed orange worth of juice

## For Garnish
- tortillas
- avocado
- cilantro
- lime
- Cojita cheese

# Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F if braising in the oven. You can also cook this in a crock pot.
1. Combine salt and spices. Evenly coat the pork pieces.
1. Heat oil in a dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add in seasoned pork and sear on all sides for about 1 minute per side. Remove pork from the dutch oven. You will probably have to batch sear the pork, especially if doubling or tripling this recipe.
1. Pour in the beer (or chicken stock) and scrape the bottom of the dutch oven to deglaze the pot. Add in the orange juice.
1. Add in the seared pork. Cover dutch oven and place in oven for 1/2 hour or put everything in your crock pot on high for a 1/2 hour.
1. Remove lid and turn pork pieces over. Return to oven uncovered for 1 1/2 - 2 hours or turn crock pot down to low for the same amount of time. Turn pork a couple of times while cooking.
1. Shred pork and toss with sauce.
1. Make tacos!
